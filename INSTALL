If you compile by hand, double-check you first compile SDL, then SDL_image
and SDL_mixer, then SDL perl, otherwise you might get the error that
NewFont.al is not found.


                Installation instructions


[*] First, build Frozen-Bubble and provide the prefix where the
game will be installed (most probably /usr or /usr/local).

make OPTIMIZE="my_arch_opt_flags" PREFIX="my_prefix"


[*] Second, install the files on the system.

   - if you're root (case when you build a Debian package, or
     when you build it locally on your own machine), you will
     choose the same prefix location than for previous step

make install PREFIX="my_prefix"


   - if you're not root (case when you build a RPM package), you
     need to install to a temporary directory where you have
     write access

make install PREFIX="/home/my_home/tmp/my_buildroot"

   Then an external program such as RPM will collect the
   installed files and write the package.
